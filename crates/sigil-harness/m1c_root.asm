; Bounded M1.C T10 harness root: the REAL games/sonic4/main.asm front-matter
; include tree + `org 0` + the 64-entry vector table, then STOP (main.asm
; continues into engine code needing generators). Faithful copy of main.asm's
; opening (verified) so a byte-match against s4.bin[0:256] proves the include
; tree parses and dc.l/symbol resolution work on real Aeon source.
;
; External CODE labels referenced by the vector table (EntryPoint, BusError, …)
; are seeded as `-D` defines / link stubs from s4.lst — see m1c_vector_table.rs.
; SYSTEM_STACK is NOT stubbed: it is a real equate defined in engine/constants.asm.
; Include paths track the engine/game split (E1-E7): the front-matter now lives
; under engine/ + games/sonic4/config/; the vector table itself matches
; engine/system/vectors.asm verbatim.

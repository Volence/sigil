# Sigil Overseer

How a Claude session runs **sigil** as its overseer. The shared role — solo-first
posture, delegation discipline, review bars, peer protocol — lives in
`empyrean/docs/OVERSEER-PROTOCOL.md`; read it once, then this file for what is
sigil-specific: the landing-lane division, the worktree/test quirks, and the queue.

## Boot

> You're the overseer for this repo. Read `docs/OVERSEER.md` first, then
> `empyrean/docs/OVERSEER-PROTOCOL.md` if you haven't. Work the queue. Peers may or
> may not be running — check `ListAgents`; coordinate if present, proceed solo if not.

## Landing-lane division — THE rule for this repo

The aeon↔sigil landing lane has **one owner, and it is the aeon overseer** (owner
directive, 2026-08-19). Aeon-paired byte-movers — golden refreezes, the provenance
chain, pin updates — land through aeon's session. One session sequencing them is why
a 16-refreeze day (chain 134→149) had zero collisions; a parallel refreeze against
shared goldens is exactly the collision this rule prevents.

**The sigil overseer owns everything sigil-internal:**

- the `.emp` language work (Spec 2 — specs in `empyrean/docs/SIGIL_*.md`)
- the CLI (`crates/sigil-cli`), the frontends, the backends, the linker
- the port-test harness (`crates/sigil-harness`) and its test-support seams
- sigil-only parcels: anything whose landing does not move aeon-paired bytes

**COORDINATE with the aeon session before touching any of:**

- `crates/sigil-harness/golden/` (and `golden/provenance.toml`)
- `crates/sigil-harness/src/pins.rs`
- `crates/sigil-harness/repin.toml`

If a sigil-internal change would ripple into those files, message the aeon overseer
(find it via `ListAgents`; address by repo, not session name) and let that session
sequence the landing. A byte-changing parcel ripples past `pins.rs` into
`engine.inc` / `mixed_dac_rom.rs` / `repin_pins.rs` — the repin tool auto-updates
only `pins.rs`; the rest are hand-edited, and `repin.toml` changes only when a
region is added. That whole ripple belongs to the aeon-owned lane.

Provenance identity is **CRC32 + size**, never SHA1 — the campaign standard.

## Quality bars

- **Full suite bar:** `cargo test --release --workspace --no-fail-fast` with
  `AEON_DIR` set to the aeon tree — currently **3752 passed / 0 failed**. Never plain
  `cargo test`: without `--release` some gates are impractically slow, without
  `--workspace --no-fail-fast` a wedge or an early failure hides the rest of the
  result set. Report failures-first with explicit pass/fail counts; never
  `grep | head` test output (it buries FAILED lines).
- **Pre-merge:** re-run the suite on the merged tree with `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1`, which
  turns reference-tree skips into failures so the port gates cannot silently skip.
- **Port work** follows the port loop (canonical:
  `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-port-loop.md` — byte gate is step-1 only, then
  modernize/retrospect/back-prop/optimize until dry; dry is panel-adjudicated, not
  self-declared). New-era work takes the A/B/C lens panels
  (`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-03-era-lens-loop.md`).
- Unimplemented nice-to-haves go to `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-gap-ledger.md`;
  twin scaffolding gets a kill condition in
  `docs/superpowers/notes/twin-scaffolding-kill-list.md`, same commit.
- Comments describe present-tense function, never change history. Commit with
  explicit paths only — never `git add -u` in this shared checkout — and check the
  branch before every commit.

## Worktree and environment quirks

- **Worktrees are agent-isolated but the registry is repo-global.** Every session's
  worktrees live under `.worktrees/` off this main checkout and share one
  `git worktree list`. Check the list before adding (names collide across sessions),
  and prune stale entries — ~18 accumulate fast on a busy day.
- **Port tests need the aeon tree.** `AEON_DIR` selects it
  (`crates/sigil-harness/src/test_support.rs::aeon_dir`, default
  `/home/volence/sonic_hacks/aeon`); when the referenced paths are absent the gates
  skip green unless `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1`. A worktree agent running port tests must
  be told which aeon tree to point at — and beware the aeon-side worktree trap: a
  fresh aeon worktree missing its gitignored `games/sonic4/data/editor/` builds a
  padded, wrong ROM.
- **The `*_port` cross-seam trap:** the standalone port oracles lower ONE aeon module
  against a hand-picked dep list, so they see neither the whole-program contract bind
  (which resolves `Game.MEMBER`) nor `scene_dsl.emp` (which declares the `CAP_*`
  bits). A new `Game.*` / `CAP_*` reference in an engine module therefore breaks ~9
  port tests silently (`unknown name Game.SCANLINE_CAPS` at lower time). The fix
  pattern is `crates/sigil-harness/src/test_support.rs` §4: synthesize the interface
  + `implement` and the `pub const CAP_*` block, both **derived from the aeon tree at
  test runtime** via `emp_const_rhs` / `emp_const_literal` — never a copied literal.
- **Never build in the scratchpad/tmp** — `/tmp` is tmpfs; a cargo build there wedges
  the shell. Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to disk for any out-of-tree build.

## Queue

The standing sigil-native arc is the **`.emp` language work (Spec 2)** — specs in
`empyrean/docs/SIGIL_*.md`. Current state (2026-08-19): the whole sound stack is
sigil-native, the language round + §17 optimization arc + conversion tail are done,
and the map drives the build. Landed today: the `released_by_rte` context release
form, the equate-listing `.lst` section, and the `emp_const_rhs` test-support seam —
all merged.

For live next-work, read newest-first: the most recent dated `HANDOFF`/packet notes
in `docs/superpowers/notes/`, then `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-gap-ledger.md`
for banked nice-to-haves. Keep this section's "current state" paragraph fresh when
landing an arc — a stale queue snapshot misleads the next boot more than no snapshot.

# Sigil Overseer

How a Claude session runs **sigil** as its overseer. The shared role — solo-first
posture, delegation discipline, review bars, peer protocol — lives in
`empyrean/docs/OVERSEER-PROTOCOL.md`; read it once, then this file for what is
sigil-specific: the landing-lane division, the worktree/test quirks, and the queue.

## Boot

> You're the overseer for this repo. Read `docs/OVERSEER.md` first, then
> `empyrean/docs/OVERSEER-PROTOCOL.md` if you haven't. Work the queue. Peers may or
> may not be running — check `ListAgents`; coordinate if present, proceed solo if not.

## Landing-lane division — THE rule for this repo

The aeon↔sigil landing lane has **one owner, and it is the aeon overseer** (owner
directive, 2026-08-19). Aeon-paired byte-movers — golden refreezes, the provenance
chain, pin updates — land through aeon's session. One session sequencing them is why
a 16-refreeze day (chain 134→149) had zero collisions; a parallel refreeze against
shared goldens is exactly the collision this rule prevents.

**The sigil overseer owns everything sigil-internal:**

- the `.emp` language work (Spec 2 — specs in `empyrean/docs/SIGIL_*.md`)
- the CLI (`crates/sigil-cli`), the frontends, the backends, the linker
- the port-test harness (`crates/sigil-harness`) and its test-support seams
- sigil-only parcels: anything whose landing does not move aeon-paired bytes

**COORDINATE with the aeon session before touching any of:**

- `crates/sigil-harness/golden/` (and `golden/provenance.toml`)
- `crates/sigil-harness/src/pins.rs`
- `crates/sigil-harness/repin.toml`

If a sigil-internal change would ripple into those files, message the aeon overseer
(find it via `ListAgents`; address by repo, not session name) and let that session
sequence the landing. A byte-changing parcel ripples past `pins.rs` into
`engine.inc` / `mixed_dac_rom.rs` / `repin_pins.rs` — the repin tool auto-updates
only `pins.rs`; the rest are hand-edited, and `repin.toml` changes only when a
region is added. That whole ripple belongs to the aeon-owned lane.

Provenance identity is **CRC32 + size**, never SHA1 — the campaign standard.

## Quality bars

- **Full suite bar:** `cargo test --release --workspace --no-fail-fast` with
  `AEON_DIR` set to the aeon tree — currently **3779 passed / 0 failed / 4 ignored**
  under `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1` against a clean aeon tree (master `34d887c4`,
  2026-08-22), with **zero `skip:` lines** in the run — check that, not just the
  totals: a reference gate that skips reports nothing and reads as coverage. Never plain
  `cargo test`: without `--release` some gates are impractically slow, without
  `--workspace --no-fail-fast` a wedge or an early failure hides the rest of the
  result set. Report failures-first with explicit pass/fail counts; never
  `grep | head` test output (it buries FAILED lines).
- **Pre-merge:** re-run the suite on the merged tree with `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1`, which
  turns reference-tree skips into failures so the port gates cannot silently skip.
- **Port work** follows the port loop (canonical:
  `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-port-loop.md` — byte gate is step-1 only, then
  modernize/retrospect/back-prop/optimize until dry; dry is panel-adjudicated, not
  self-declared). New-era work takes the A/B/C lens panels
  (`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-08-03-era-lens-loop.md`).
- Unimplemented nice-to-haves go to `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-gap-ledger.md`;
  twin scaffolding gets a kill condition in
  `docs/superpowers/notes/twin-scaffolding-kill-list.md`, same commit.
- Comments describe present-tense function, never change history. Commit with
  explicit paths only — never `git add -u` in this shared checkout — and check the
  branch before every commit.

## Worktree and environment quirks

- **Worktrees are agent-isolated but the registry is repo-global.** Every session's
  worktrees live under `.worktrees/` off this main checkout and share one
  `git worktree list`. Check the list before adding (names collide across sessions),
  and prune stale entries — ~18 accumulate fast on a busy day.
- **Port tests need the aeon tree.** `AEON_DIR` selects it
  (`crates/sigil-harness/src/test_support.rs::aeon_dir`, default
  `/home/volence/sonic_hacks/aeon`); when the referenced paths are absent the gates
  skip green unless `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1`. A worktree agent running port tests must
  be told which aeon tree to point at — and beware the aeon-side worktree trap: a
  fresh aeon worktree missing its gitignored `games/sonic4/data/editor/` builds a
  padded, wrong ROM.
- **The `*_port` cross-seam trap:** the standalone port oracles lower ONE aeon module
  against a hand-picked dep list, so they see neither the whole-program contract bind
  (which resolves `Game.MEMBER`) nor `scene_dsl.emp` (which declares the `CAP_*`
  bits). A new `Game.*` / `CAP_*` reference in an engine module therefore breaks ~9
  port tests silently (`unknown name Game.SCANLINE_CAPS` at lower time). The fix
  pattern is `crates/sigil-harness/src/test_support.rs` §4: synthesize the interface
  + `implement` and the `pub const CAP_*` block, both **derived from the aeon tree at
  test runtime** via `emp_const_rhs` / `emp_const_literal` — never a copied literal.
- **Never build in the scratchpad/tmp** — `/tmp` is tmpfs; a cargo build there wedges
  the shell. Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to disk for any out-of-tree build.
- **The main aeon checkout carries the owner's live editor content edits** (collision
  bins, regenerated act-pool pages under `games/sonic4/data/`) for hours or days at a
  time — never gate a green on that tree cleaning up. A strict-gate or landing run
  that matters points `AEON_DIR` at a CLEAN WORKTREE of a committed aeon SHA, with all
  four shapes built there first (repin resolves but does not generate). File seeding is
  RETIRED (`aeon/tools/seed-worktree.sh` is a copies-nothing stub; the OJZ tree and
  collision tables are committed, generated dirs rebuild via build.sh). What a fresh
  aeon worktree DOES need: the `.worktrees/sigil` and `skdisasm` symlinks, plus a
  PAIRED sigil worktree of the same name at `sigil/.worktrees/<name>` — the
  emp-helper-closure locator hard-asserts that pairing and fails the build without it.
  Verify the built ROMs against `golden/provenance.toml` (CRC32+size) before trusting
  the worktree. Mid-brushstroke aeon
  edits flipping sigil port-gate results is environmental, not signal; the tell is
  broad `*_port` region-diff failures at embedded addresses plus
  `repin_pins::pins_rs_is_current` failing identically on sigil master.

## Queue

The standing sigil-native arc is the **`.emp` language work (Spec 2)** — specs in
`empyrean/docs/SIGIL_*.md`. The whole sound stack is sigil-native, the language round
+ §17 optimization arc + conversion tail are done, and the map drives the build.

**Current state (2026-08-22, master `34d887c4`).** Landed today: **const-arity** — a
typed comptime `const` literal is now array-arity checked at elaboration (the length
check lived only in the byte-emission path, which a `const` never reaches, so a
wrong-shaped constant compiled clean); and the **Oracle listing gate's `ORACLE_DIR`
default**, which had gone stale at the oracle/oracle-old rename and made
`SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1` — the pre-merge bar this very file names — unsatisfiable.

Also landed today: **`feat/m68k-roundtrip`** (an m68k decoder mirror, a round-trip pass
over every shipped shape's emitted stream, and an opcode sweep) — carrying the real ISA
fix it surfaced: `TST` takes `DATA_ALTERABLE` on the MC68000, not `DATA`, so the old row
admitted nine words the hardware traps. Latent, never emitted, derived four ways. Its
packet's soundness claim was corrected rather than kept — the sweep's oracle is
`encode()`, so it proves decoder-subset-of-encoder and **cannot see a defect both halves
share**; `TST` was exactly that, live.

**Front of the queue, in order:**

1. **`feat/game-defines`** (8 commits, unmerged) — the aeon `emp_defines` ask. Two
   self-recorded lens latents to close first.
2. **Ungate the warn-tier corpus run from refreeze** — ruled 2026-08-22, owed to the
   aeon session for a `docs/OVERSEER.md` cross-reference. A ritual keyed to byte
   movement cannot see a source-derived lint set move; six consecutive zero-byte aeon
   parcels proved it by hiding a real odd-address finding for a day.
3. **A provenance witness for the shared binary** — `sigil --version` reporting the
   revision it was built from. The shared assembler sat three days stale while every
   aeon build used it, and byte identity is silent on that by construction. Class-level
   row in the ledger.
4. **A Capstone differential as a permanent gate** — the only non-circular ISA oracle
   available, already installed; it found the `TST` bug on its first run. Two
   known-benign disagreements must be excluded by name (`6xFF` branch words, `btst
   Dn,#imm` sizing).
5. **An alignment attribute / even-offset assertion** — the class-level fix for the
   odd-field finding: today a struct wanting even-aligned members can only say so by
   hand-counting bytes into a pad, and the pad goes stale silently.

And **`feat/arity-cli-fixture`** — a CLI-level regression test for const arity, driving
the built binary via `CARGO_BIN_EXE_sigil` over a committed poison/control pair, taking
no `AEON_DIR` at all. It exists because the enforcement was covered only at the
frontend-unit level while aeon invokes the **binary** — which is how a three-day-stale
shared assembler went unnoticed. Red-first on both arms: the poison arm against the
enforcement reverted, the control arm against the check made unconditional, because a
reject-everything compiler satisfies the poison arm and is caught only by the control.

**Nothing is in flight; no agents are running.**

For anything else read newest-first: the dated notes in `docs/superpowers/notes/`
(start with `2026-08-22-warn-tier-drift-open.md`), then
`docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-gap-ledger.md`, whose tail carries eleven rows added
2026-08-22 — refinement bounds unchecked on every binding form, interface `const`
members getting a shape-only check, the `emp_const_rhs` scraper that breaks on any
const gaining a type, a Capstone differential as the only non-circular ISA oracle,
and the `--extra-entry` liveness hazard (a red obtained there proves an assertion's
logic, never that it is reached).

For live next-work, read newest-first: the most recent dated `HANDOFF`/packet notes
in `docs/superpowers/notes/`, then `docs/superpowers/notes/campaign-gap-ledger.md`
for banked nice-to-haves. Keep this section's "current state" paragraph fresh when
landing an arc — a stale queue snapshot misleads the next boot more than no snapshot.

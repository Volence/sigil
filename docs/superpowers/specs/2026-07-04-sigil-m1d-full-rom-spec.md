# Sigil M1.D — Full-ROM Byte-Exactness — Design (audit-revised)

**Status:** approved (independent audit revision 2026-07-04; supersedes the ordering in
`2026-07-04-sigil-m1d-full-rom-handoff.md` — that doc remains valid as the M1.C landing
record)
**Milestone:** M1.D (follows M1.C, merged `aadf98b`)
**Crates:** `sigil-frontend-as`, `sigil-link`, `sigil-ir`, `sigil-harness` (+ doc backports
to `empyrean/docs/SIGIL_CORE_SPEC.md`)
**Reference toolchain:** `asl 1.42 Beta Build 212` → `p2bin` → `convsym` (no-op) → `fixheader`
**Reference source pin:** re-pin aeon at M1.D start (T0.0); the handoff-era pin was `9bacc93`

---

## 0. What changed since the handoff — the 2026-07-04 audit

Four independent review passes (architecture-vs-spec, phase/dephase semantics vs live asl,
linker width-fold soundness, golden-vector provenance) ran against merged M1.C. Confirmed
sound: crate quarantine + one-way graph (enforced by `crate_graph.rs`), the oracle
discipline (all 368 committed goldens regenerate byte-identical from real asl — non-circular
proven; fresh 24-snippet differential vs live asl scored 23/24), the phase/dephase
continuous-physical model (14 live asl probes, all match), and the M1.B width rule
(`asl_width_rule` boundary-swept, `-A` proven irrelevant).

The audit **upgraded two known items and found two new ones**. These reshape M1.D:

- **F1 (NEW, byte-affecting): `padding` is wrong across `save`/`cpu`/`restore`.**
  Live-asl probes show `restore` re-applies the saved CPU, and a CPU *switch* resets
  `padding` to the new CPU's default (ON for 68k): `padding off; save; cpu z80; …;
  restore` ends with padding **ON** (probe t14), while `save; restore` with no CPU change
  preserves it (t12); `cpu z80; cpu 68000` alone resets it (t13). Aeon's only save/restore
  pattern (boot.asm's Z80 load blocks, ~`boot.asm:280`) changes CPU — so in the **real**
  reference build, everything after boot.asm assembles with padding **ON**, despite
  `padding off` at `main.asm:3`. Sigil preserves OFF. Additionally sigil implements
  padding only as struct `ds.w/ds.l` offset rounding (`eval.rs:1413`), not asl's observed
  pad-byte-before-word-emission-at-odd-PC (t9/t10). Currently latent (no tested region
  emits a word at odd PC), i.e. a first-diff landmine. The `state.rs` header comment
  claiming this exact behavior was "probe-verified" is **contradicted by the probes** —
  see the probe-first process rule (§4).
- **F2 (UPGRADED risk→certainty): stale-fold under jmp/jsr width growth.** The object
  bank (`org $10000`) contains **11 bare-symbol `jmp/jsr` sites that grow abs.w→abs.l**
  (asl's own listing shows `4EF9` at ROM `$1012E`, `$1041E`, `$10486`, …; +22 bytes
  total). The front-end advances the cursor by a fixed 4 per site (`eval.rs:2082`) and
  folds nearly every label reference at those **baseline** values; `resolve_layout` shifts
  labels/fixups but not already-folded bytes. Two guaranteed failures once emit runs:
  stale folded pointer tables inside the bank, and — **unflagged by the handoff** — stale
  **downstream section LMAs** (`phys_base` accumulates baseline lengths, so the Z80 driver
  lands 22 bytes early; `resolve_layout` never re-flows section LMAs, `relax.rs:284-291`).
  Today the `Org+JmpJsrSym` guard (`relax.rs:158-181`) fails loud on that exact section —
  a tripwire, not a fix. Fix direction is settled: **move width selection into the
  front-end pass loop** (T3).
- **F3 (NEW, small): `cmpm` is encodable (`sigil-isa`) but missing from the front-end
  mnemonic table** — hard diagnostic, debug-build-only exposure
  (`engine/debug/compression_selftest.asm:83` under `ifdef __DEBUG__`). Blocks A2.
- **F4 (confirmed): the empyrean spec is stale on ≥4 asl-verified points** (comparisons
  fold 0/1 not 0/−1; `int()` = floor; the `strstr` last-char bug does not exist in asl
  1.42; `save/restore` state set) and describes never-built architecture
  (`ProvenanceStack`, `RelaxableFragment`/`ChosenSizes`, full `Diagnostic`, full
  `IrStreamer`, frontend→backend edge prohibition). A future agent grounding on it will
  mis-build — this failure mode has already occurred once in project history (see
  `SIGIL_PLAN_AUDIT_2026-07-01.md` F3). Backport is now in-milestone scope (T7).

Recon reality check (re-run 2026-07-04): the raw diagnostic count is ~2.0 M, but it
reduces to **one root cause** (string-valued `set` / `__FSTRING`, fanned out by a
non-convergent `while` scan loop) + **6 deferred EA sites over 3 distinct symbols**
(`OJZ_Act1_Descriptor` ×4, `BGND_Palette`, `OJZ_Palette`) + 2 one-offs (`… directive
expects …`, `unresolved long expression`). The handoff's "~19" counted distinct sites.

---

## 1. Goal & exit criteria

| Gate | Criterion |
|---|---|
| **A1** | `sha256(sigil_s4.bin) == sha256(ref_s4.bin)` for the **non-debug** build, full pipeline (assemble → resolve_layout → link → emit_rom), reference freshly built by `aeon/build.sh` at the T0.0 pin |
| **A2** | Same for the **`__DEBUG__`** build (requires F3 fix + a deliberately-built debug reference ROM) |
| **A3** | The ~42-symbol M0 stub table is **deleted**; the full build defines everything itself (the recon already runs with zero stubs) |
| **A4** | `SIGIL_CORE_SPEC.md` reconciled: 4 verified corrections backported, architecture supersessions recorded (T7) |

Everything is measured against **fresh** asl output at a pinned aeon commit; never
against stale on-disk artifacts (golden-provenance rule, `golden/PROVENANCE.md`).

---

## 2. Task breakdown (dependency order)

### T0 — Groundwork (independent of the assembly blocker; start immediately)

**T0.0 — Re-pin the reference. ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).** Pinned clean `9bacc93`:
len **450878**, sha256 `605631da…ad5117`, `0x18E`=**`0xcfc3`**. **Key finding:** the
M1.B pin (458666/`0x5CBE`) was captured with a *dirty* aeon tree — the build is
non-hermetic (python generators consume editor JSON), so a clean `9bacc93` differs.
Stashed aeon's forest_bg/editor WIP to get a reproducible pin. `regen` byte-identical
(region A 5896 B, B 1543 B). Recorded in `PROVENANCE.md`. Recon re-run against the
clean tree: same structure (2M → T1 string-set root cause + 6 T2 EA sites + 3 one-offs).

**T0.1 — `padding` fidelity (fixes F1). ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).** Probe-first: 17
live-asl probes (matrix in `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-07-04-m1d-t0.1-padding-probes.md`)
established **hypothesis A** (fits every row): (1) the `cpu X` directive resets
padding/supmode to CPU defaults **unconditionally, even same-CPU** (probe d: `padding
off; cpu 68000`→ON); (2) `save` snapshots only the CPU; `restore` re-applies it and
resets padding/supmode to default **only on an actual CPU change** (t14→ON, t12→OFF) and
**never restores the saved padding value** (probes b/c decisive). Also verified padding
aligns on the **logical `$`** (physical+disp), not physical (phase_logodd/logeven probes),
and pads before `dc.w`/`dc.l`/**instructions** at odd `$`. Implemented: `state.rs` `set_cpu`
(unconditional reset) + change-conditional `restore` + rewritten header/tests; `eval.rs`
`directive_cpu`→`set_cpu`, new `pad_word_align` helper wired into dc.w/dc.l/`lower_m68k`.
Fixed the "probe-verified" lie in the state.rs header. 7 byte-affecting snippet goldens
(regenerated from real asl: pad-on/off word/long/instr at odd PC, t14/t12/d state cases).
**All strict gates still green** (regen A+B byte-identical, m1b_gate 5, m1c_vector_table 1
— the padding-ON change is post-boot.asm, so those padding-off regions are unaffected).
The old probe-matrix items:
1. **Probe matrix against live asl** (the audit's t9–t14 probes live in a session
   scratchpad and must be re-created as committed artifacts): {padding on/off} ×
   {save/restore with and without intervening `cpu` change} × {explicit `padding`
   between save and restore} × {supmode, for completeness}; plus emission probes: `dc.w`
   / `dc.l` / `ds.w` / a 68k instruction, each at odd PC, padding on and off; struct
   `ds.w` offset rounding both ways (already covered by T7-era goldens — keep them
   green). Record results in a notes doc; encode the byte-affecting cases as
   `gen_snippet_vectors` snippet goldens so they regenerate from real asl forever.
2. **Implement to match.** Expected model (verify, don't trust): `restore` re-applies the
   saved CPU; a CPU **switch** (and only a switch) resets `padding`/`supmode` to the new
   CPU's defaults; `restore` without a CPU change leaves padding as-is. Plus real
   pad-byte-before-word/long-emission-at-odd-PC when padding is ON (this is what the
   post-boot.asm reference build actually does).
3. **Fix the `state.rs` header comment** to state the verified semantics and point at the
   committed probes.

Acceptance: new snippet goldens green; all existing strict gates still green
(`m0_acceptance`, `m1b_gate`, `m1c_vector_table` — these currently pass *with* the wrong
model, so any regression here means the new model was implemented where it shouldn't be).

**T0.2 — Commit the stale-fold reproducer (fixes nothing; pins F2). ✅ DONE
(2026-07-04).** `crates/sigil-frontend-as/tests/stale_fold_repro.rs`. Used the
**guard-free variant** (`phase $10000` sets the base via displacement, emits no `Org`
fragment → labels resolve `>$8000` → the bare `jmp` grows abs.w→abs.l, without tripping
resolve_layout's `Org+JmpJsrSym` guard) — isolates the defect cleanly. Two
`#[ignore = "flips green in T3"]` tests assert asl-1.42-verified correct output:
`dc_l_after_grown_jmp_folds_correctly` (single section, flatten = `4EF9 0001 0006 0001
0006` — the folded `dc.l` must be `$10006` not the stale baseline `$10004`) and
`downstream_section_lma_reflows_after_growth` (two sections; `SecondSection` LMA must be
`$0A`, not the stale `$08` — **this pins the half the handoff did not flag**). Companion
`*_documents_current_bug` tests pass today (tripwires; T3 deletes them). Verified: default
run 2 pass / 2 ignored; `--ignored` run the 2 correct-behavior tests FAIL (`...04` vs
`...06`; lma 8 vs 10). Both asl-truths captured live.

**T0.3 — Repair the M0 live harness. ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).** Added `padding off` to
`harness_root.asm` (after `cpu 68000`, mirroring aeon `main.asm:3`) — cleared the
`DacSample struct is 10 bytes, expected 9` regen abort. `regen` now exits 0 and
byte-matches (region A 5896 B, B 1543 B); goldens refreshed. Both live tests
(`harness_assembles_regions_a_and_b_together`, `assemble_reference_regions_returns_both_sections`)
pass with `--ignored` (the `#[ignore]` stays — it gates on the live aeon tree, like
the strict gates). **T0.1 interaction still open:** once padding-on/pad-byte semantics
land, re-verify the harness reproduces aeon's *effective* padding at each region.

**T0.4 — `cmpm` in the front-end mnemonic table (fixes F3). ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).**
Root cause was even smaller than expected: `M68kMnemonic` is a *type alias* for the
isa `Mnemonic`, so `Cmpm` already existed and the `(Ay)+,(Ax)+` operand shape already
lowered (shared with `addx`). One line — `"cmpm" => Cmpm` in the mnemonic table — plus
two asl-generated goldens: `cmpm.w (a0)+,(a1)+`→`B3 48` (aeon's real form,
compression_selftest.asm:83) and `cmpm.b (a3)+,(a2)+`→`B5 0B` (matches the spec's
predicted `B5 0B`). Regen churned only the 2 new blocks (non-circularity intact).
Unblocks A2.

### T1 — String-valued `set` symbols + `__FSTRING` (the assembly blocker). ✅ DONE (2026-07-04).

**Result:** recon **2,000,702 → 7 diagnostics** — the `strstr` (2,000,198) /
`strlen` (99) / `while`-non-convergent (99) / `trailing tokens` (297) /
`per-pass budget` (1) classes all dropped to **0**, and the 2 prior one-offs
(`directive expects …`, `unresolved long expression`) cleared as downstream of
the string failures. Remaining 7 = the 6 T2 EA sites + **1 newly-exposed**
(bucketed below).

**Design decision (resolves the spec's "Extend `SymbolValue` to `Int | Str`"):**
strings do **NOT** enter `sigil_ir::SymbolValue` (it stays `Int | Poison`,
`#[derive(Copy)]` — structurally can't hold a `String`). Per §7.4, string-valued
`set` symbols live in a new **front-end-local** `str_env: HashMap<String,String>`
on `Asm`, keyed by qualified name exactly like `env`. `directive_set` tries
`eval_str` first (literal / `substr` / `lowstring` / string-symbol copy) →
`str_env`; else the numeric `eval_all` → `env`. `eval_str` gained a lone-ident
branch (`resolve_str`, mirroring `SymbolTable::resolve`) so builtins resolve a
string **symbol**, not just a literal. The `while` converges for free once
`strstr(.__str,"%<")` returns -1. NOT carried across passes (asl `set` is a
sequential per-pass assignment; every `__FSTRING` symbol is assigned before read
— probe p1/p4). Invariant documented at `directive_set`: a symbol is int XOR
string per pass; type-flipping `set` is unsupported (un-probed → not enforced).

**Newly-exposed items (probe-first, both handled during T1):**
1. **Infix `!` is XOR, not bitwise-OR** — decisive on the `__ErrorMessage`
   `.__align_flag: set (((*)&1)!1)*$80` emit path. Probed (`1!1`=0, `3!1`=2,
   `5!3`=6; OR and XOR agree only on the one prior golden `3!4`=7). Fixed:
   `BinOp::Xor` + `Bang => BinOp::Xor`. (Commit `c09752e`.)
2. **`capture_macro` colon-label param-shift** (latent, pre-existing) — the
   colon-form head `NAME: macro p` left the `macro` keyword as a phantom first
   param, shifting every real param by one. The real `__FSTRING`/`__ErrorMessage`
   macros use the colon form, so this had to be fixed for T1. Peeled via the
   existing `parse_line_tokens`; non-colon form unchanged. `m1c_vector_table`
   (real `main.asm` macro tree) still green → no regression. (Commit `498466b`.)

**Bucketed for recon-0 / T2 (do NOT re-discover):** the 1 remaining
newly-exposed diagnostic is `` `END` is not a recognized 68000 mnemonic `` —
AS's `end` directive (uppercase, at the end of the source tree), previously
masked by the string failures. Needs a no-op / entry-point directive handler.
Belongs with T2 (both must clear to reach recon-0).

**Probes committed:** `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-07-04-m1d-t1-string-set-probes.md`
(6 string-symbol cases + the `!`-XOR matrix + the full `__ErrorMessage` reference
bytes `4EB9 00000400 / "BUS ERROR" / 00 / A1 / 00 / 4EF9 00000500`). **Goldens:**
8 new asl-verified snippet blocks (`t1_*`); `gen_snippet_vectors` churned only
those 8 (non-circularity intact). **Plan:**
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-04-sigil-m1d-t1-string-set.md`. **Commits:**
`c09752e` (XOR) → `cd82435` (str_env) → `498466b` (capture_macro) → `9816e53`
(goldens) → `b26972d` (review-fix docs). Two-stage review: spec ✅, code
quality ✅ (ship-ready). All strict gates green (m1b_gate 5, m1c_vector_table 1,
harness 16, workspace, clippy `-D warnings`).

---

**Original scope (for reference).** `error_handler.asm`'s
`__ErrorMessage` macros are not `__DEBUG__`-guarded, so the **non-debug** ROM runs
`__FSTRING_GenerateArgumentsCode`, which stores strings in symbols (`.__str: set "…"`)
and scans them with `substr`/`strstr`/switch-on-string (`debugger.asm:647-659`,
`error_handler.asm:31-65`). Extend `SymbolValue` to `Int | Str`, thread string values
through `set`/expression evaluation/the existing string builtins, and make the scan
`while` loop converge.

§7.4 contamination safeguard still applies: strings live in the front-end evaluator
only; nothing string-typed enters `sigil-ir`.

Probe-first: each builtin's edge cases (empty string, `substr` len 0 = to-end, `strstr`
miss = ?, `val` on a string-valued symbol, comparison of string symbols) against live
asl, encoded as snippet goldens where byte-affecting.

Acceptance: the recon (`m1c_full`) drops the `strstr`/`strlen`/`while`/`trailing tokens`
classes to **0**; remaining diagnostics ≤ the 6 known EA sites + anything newly exposed
(bucket and record them); the emitted `__ErrorMessage` bytes for a representative macro
invocation match asl (snippet golden).

### T2 — The 6 deferred EA sites (3 symbols)

Small, bounded: the T5b-deferred symbolic-operand forms at `OJZ_Act1_Descriptor` (×4),
`BGND_Palette`, `OJZ_Palette`. Locate with `FILTER="out of scope" m1c_full`. Snippet
goldens per form. Acceptance: recon reaches **0 diagnostics** (with T1), which arms the
`m1c_rom` emit path for the first time.

### T3 — Width selection moves into the front-end pass loop (fixes F2)

The architectural fix, replacing the linker-side growth machinery on the front-end path.

**Design (settled by the audit; verify the one open semantic by probe):**
- In `lower_jmp_jsr_sym`-class lowering, pick abs.w/abs.l **per pass** from the current
  env via the existing pinned `asl_width_rule`; advance the cursor by the **true** width
  (2-word or 3-word form); let the existing `env == prev` convergence absorb growth
  exactly as asl's own repeat-until-stable does.
- **Probe first:** what width does asl assume for a symbol *unknown in the current pass*
  (expected: the long/pessimistic form — verify), and does a
  width-depends-on-own-address construct oscillate or converge in asl (the `$FF8000`
  non-monotone note in `relax.rs:126-143` says asl can oscillate — confirm it stays
  unreachable for ROM-targeting jmp/jsr and record the probe).
- Consequences to implement, not hope for: `phys_base` now accumulates **true** section
  lengths → downstream LMAs (the Z80 driver) correct by construction — the unflagged
  half of F2 closes for free. `PASS_CAP = 8` must be raised or made growth-aware
  (growth consumes extra convergence passes).
- The linker keeps `asl_width_rule` + `resolve_layout` as a **verification assert** on
  the front-end path (widths already final → zero growth expected; assert it) and as the
  live relaxer for hand-built IR (m1b_gate). Keep the `Org+JmpJsrSym` guard as a
  tripwire. Whether `Fragment::JmpJsrSym` survives on the front-end path or the
  front-end emits finished `Data`+fixup is implementer's choice at plan time — record it.
- In-scope adjacent hardening (both audit-flagged, both bite at full-ROM link): `link()`
  symbol redefinition is silently last-write-wins (`sigil-link/src/lib.rs:47-49`) — make
  it a diagnostic; `sec{vma}` auto-names collide for a future second bank phased at the
  same address (`eval.rs:1611`) — disambiguate (e.g. ordinal suffix).

Acceptance: T0.2's reproducer flips green with byte-correct output; all snippet goldens
and strict gates still green; the 11 real growth sites produce `4EF9` at the asl-listing
addresses (spot-assert `$1012E` in a bounded harness if cheap).

### T4 — First full-ROM emit + first-diff triage (A1)

With recon at 0, run `m1c_rom` (assemble → resolve_layout → link → emit_rom vs
`s4.bin`). Expect second-order surprises — this path has never run on real source.
Triage protocol per divergence: first differing offset → map through `s4.lst` (asl's
listing, or sigil's `emit_listing`) to the source line → classify (encoder? fold?
padding? layout?) → **cure at the source of the class, add the missing snippet golden,
re-run** — never patch bytes. F1's padding divergence is the predicted first hit if T0.1
was incomplete.

Acceptance: `sha256` match, non-debug; promote `m1c_rom` from example to a
`SIGIL_STRICT_GATE` test `m1d_rom` (skip-green without aeon, like the others).

### T5 — `__DEBUG__` build parity (A2)

Build the debug reference deliberately (aeon's `__DEBUG__` switch; record the exact
invocation in PROVENANCE.md — the debug ROM is NOT the shipped `s4.bin`). Assemble the
same config in sigil; sha256 match. Known dependency: T0.4 (`cmpm`). Expect the debug
surface (debugger.asm's `.ATTRIBUTE`/`switch`/`lowstring` paths, already implemented in
M1.C) to get its first whole-image exercise.

### T6 — Delete the stub table (A3)

The ~42-symbol M0 stub table exists only because the M0-era harness assembled the Z80
regions without the 68k side. The full build defines everything (recon: zero stubs).
Delete it; re-run the M0 acceptance path via the full-build machinery. Acceptance: no
stub file, all gates green.

### T7 — Spec + doc reconciliation (A4; anytime, must land before milestone close)

1. **`empyrean/docs/SIGIL_CORE_SPEC.md` backports:** comparisons fold **0/1** (§7.1/§4.5);
   `int()` = **floor** (header/D8); **remove the normative `strstr` bug-for-bug paragraph**
   (§7.1) and its §12 R3 risk entry (disproven in asl 1.42 Bld 212); `save/restore`
   preserve cpu/padding/supmode with the **T0.1-verified reset-on-CPU-switch semantics**
   (§7.1). Each with a "verified 2026-07-0X vs asl 1.42 Bld 212" note.
2. **Architecture supersession notes** (same doc, same pattern as the existing salsa
   deferral note): `ProvenanceStack` deferred (nodes carry `Span` only — record it as a
   *decision*, revisit at Spec 3); `Diagnostic` narrowed to `{level, message, primary}`;
   §4.3 `RelaxableFragment`/`ChosenSizes` superseded by `JmpJsrSym`+`resolve_layout`,
   itself superseded by T3 front-end width selection; §4.9 `IrStreamer` narrowed (no
   `emit_instruction`/`set_phase`/push-pop state); §9.1 frontend→backends edge blessed
   (D1 rationale from the M1.C design); §8.4 CI-gate wording → reality (reference gates
   run locally via `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1`; GitHub CI self-skips them).
3. **Stale-comment sweep:** `gen_snippet_vectors.rs:15-17` + `asl_snippets.rs:3`
   ("hand-verified" → generator-produced, demonstrably true); README status table (M0
   live-gate caveat until T0.3 lands; M1 row); `sigil-isa/src/m68k.rs` phrasing is
   already honest ("the set Aeon uses") — make README/memory phrasing match it.

---

## 3. Sequencing & rationale

```
T0.0 → {T0.1, T0.2, T0.3, T0.4}   (parallel, no blockers)
T1 → T2 → (recon = 0) → T3 → T4 (A1) → T5 (A2) → T6 (A3)
T7 anytime; before close
```

T0 first because all four items are cheap, independent of the blocker, and two of them
(T0.1, T0.2) convert audit findings into committed, executable truth *now* — the padding
divergence and the stale-fold failure must not be re-discovered at T4 as mystery diffs.
T3 sits after recon-0 only because its acceptance needs the real growth sites
assemblable; its design work can start any time. The handoff's original ordering deferred
F1/F2 understanding to "when it bites" — this spec front-loads them.

---

## 4. Process requirements (carry-forward + audit-hardened)

- **Probe-first, committed-probe:** any claim about asl semantics is established by
  running the live binary *before* implementation, and the probe must survive the session
  — as a `gen_snippet_vectors` golden when byte-affecting, or a checked-in notes doc with
  the probe source when not. A comment saying "probe-verified" without a committed
  artifact is what produced F1. Never trust a spec/doc claim over a probe (this
  milestone deletes one disproven spec bug and corrects three spec facts).
- **Every byte-affecting change lands with real-asl goldens** (`gen_snippet_vectors`
  regenerates as a no-op — the audit's non-circularity proof depends on keeping this
  invariant).
- **Strict gates before merge:** `SIGIL_STRICT_GATE=1 AEON_DIR=… cargo test -p
  sigil-harness` + workspace tests + `clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- **Cure at the source of the class** (R7): on any ROM diff, fix the semantic class and
  add the missing golden; never special-case bytes.
- **Update this doc + the memory note as tasks land** (mark done, record snags, record
  the T3 fragment-representation decision).

## 5. Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | T3 probe reveals asl's unknown-forward-symbol width guess differs from expected, or an oscillation reachable in aeon | Probe before design freeze; the pinned width rule + listing spot-checks (`$1012E` = `4EF9`) bound the blast radius |
| 2 | T0.1 padding model interacts with regions that are currently byte-green | Existing strict gates double as regression armor; implement behind the probe matrix, not intuition |
| 3 | T4 exposes unknown-unknowns (this path has never run on real source) | The triage protocol + first-diff→listing mapping; budget for iteration, don't promise A1 in one pass |
| 4 | Moving aeon reference drifts mid-milestone | T0.0 pin; re-pin only deliberately, with `regen` + PROVENANCE update |
| 5 | Debug reference ROM (T5) config drift vs what aeon actually ships | Record the exact build invocation in PROVENANCE.md when first produced |
